          <p>Fix had quickly caught up with Passepartout on the quayside, who was strolling and looking
            about him, since he personally did not feel obliged to see nothing.<br>
            ‘Well, my friend,’ said Fix. ‘Is your passport now stamped?’<br>
            ‘Oh! It’s you, sir,’ answered the Frenchman. ‘Much obliged. Our papers are perfectly in
            order.’<br>
            ‘And are you seeing the sights?’<br>
            ‘Yes, but we’re doing everything so quickly that I seem to be travelling in a dream. We’re
            in Suez, it would appear?’<br>
            ‘In Suez.’<br>
            ‘Which is in Egypt?’

          <p>Hey look! It is the Great Pyramid of Giza! Let me just do a quick introduction for you.<br>
            The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the
            oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day El Giza,
            Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain
            largely intact.

        <article class="page-3">
          <p>There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the
            bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was unfinished. The so-called Queen's
            Chamber and King's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure. The main part of the
            Giza complex is a set of buildings that included two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu
            (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives,
            an even smaller "satellite" pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the two temples, and
            small mastaba tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles.</p>
