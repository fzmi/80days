        <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is
          the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day
          El Giza, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to
          remain largely intact.</p>

        <p>Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to the fourth
          dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, some Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was thus built as
          a tomb over a 10- to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at 146.5 metres (481
          feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800
          years until Lincoln Cathedral was finished in 1311 AD. Originally, the Great Pyramid was
          covered by limestone casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is
          the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can
          still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories
          about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are
          based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and
          lifting them into place.</p>

        <p>There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the
          bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was unfinished. The so-called Queen's Chamber
          and King's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure. The main part of the Giza
          complex is a set of buildings that included two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu (one close
          to the pyramid and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even
          smaller "satellite" pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the two temples, and small mastaba
          tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles.</p>
