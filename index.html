    <h2>About This Project</h2>

    <article>
      <h3 class="about-title">Overview</h3>
      <p>This design project proposes an approach to combine an educational content and a non-fiction story
        into a single website, and is mainly for design students who want to build their websites from
        the beginning and need to do some research.</p>

      <h3 class="about-title">Original Story</h3>
      <p>The story starts in London on Wednesday, 2 October 1872.</p>

      <p>Phileas Fogg is a rich British gentleman living in solitude. Despite his wealth,
        Fogg lives a modest life with habits carried out with mathematical precision.
        Very little can be said about his social life other than that he is a member of the Reform Club.
        Having dismissed his former valet, James Forster, for bringing him shaving water at 84 °F (29 °C)
        instead of 86 °F (30 °C), Fogg hires Frenchman Jean Passepartout as a replacement.</p>

      <p>At the Reform Club, Fogg gets involved in an argument over an article in The Daily Telegraph
        stating that with the opening of a new railway section in India, it is now possible to travel
        around the world in 80 days. He accepts a wager for £20,000 (£2,075,400 in 2017), half of his
        total fortune, from his fellow club members to complete such a journey within this time period.
        With Passepartout accompanying him, Fogg departs from London by train at 8:45 p.m. on 2 October;
        in order to win the wager, he must return to the club by this same time on 21 December,
        80 days later. They take the remaining £20,000 of Fogg's fortune with them to cover expenses
        during the journey.</p>

    <article>
      <h3 class="about-title">Educational Content</h3>
      <p>For my educational content, I am choosing the wonders of the world. They could be in the ancient
        world, for instance, the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Colosseum in Rome, etc., or could be in the
        modern world, such as Taj Mahal in India. For each site I will have a brief introduction to broaden
        people’s mind, this may include locations, characteristics and histories of the sites. Moreover,
        I will attach site-specific photos so that the audience can enjoy the sceneries while gaining
        knowledge at the same time.</p>

      <p>The reason why I am choosing this content is that it can represent the appearances at the different
        corners of the globe. Since the target audience has no much travel experience, this website would
        be appealing to them because they can explore the world without having to step outside of their
        home.</p>
